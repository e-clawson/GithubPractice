    - Stage and commit these files.
    - Push the changes to the remote repository.
- **Update Existing Files**

    - In the same directory, update `chapter2.txt` by adding a new paragraph at the beginning.
    - Stage and commit these changes.
    - Push the changes to the remote repository.
- **Delete and Rename Files**

    - Rename `introduction.txt` to `overview.txt`.
    - Delete `summary.txt`.
    - Stage and commit the renaming and deletion operations.
    - Push the changes to the remote repository.
- **Create a Backup**

    - Create a directory called `backup` and copy all files from the `docs` directory into `backup`.
    - Stage and commit the `backup` directory.
    - Push the changes to the remote repository.
- **Final Adjustments**
